The Secret Factory Password Generator is a program that allows users to generate passwords based on their desired parameters. With this program, users can specify the number of symbols and the type of symbols they want to include in their passwords. The generated passwords can be used for various purposes, such as securing online accounts or protecting sensitive information.
The program utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, a Python library for creating GUI applications. The user interface presents a simple and intuitive design, making it easy for users to interact with the program.
Upon running the program, users are prompted to enter the number of symbols they want in their password. They can then choose the type of symbols from three options: numbers, letters, or other special characters. The program provides a visual representation of the selected symbol type.
After the user clicks the "Generate" button, the program generates a password based on the specified parameters. The generated password is displayed on the screen, along with a label indicating that it is the user's password. The program ensures that the generated password meets the desired symbol count and type.
If the user enters a number of symbols that exceeds the symbol limit or falls below a minimum limit, appropriate error messages are displayed to provide feedback.
To use the generated password, the user can simply copy it from the program's interface. The program also includes a "Copy Password" button that allows the user to conveniently copy the generated password to the clipboard.
The Secret Factory Password Generator provides a straightforward and customizable solution for generating passwords with different symbol types and lengths. It offers users a convenient way to create secure and unique passwords for their specific needs.
